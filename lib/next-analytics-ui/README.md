# @lib/next-analytics-ui

This package provides a single PageVisitTracker component for Next.js applications that automatically tracks page visits using the analytics context from @lib/analytics-ui. The component leverages Next.js's router to capture pathname changes and triggers tracking events accordingly, eliminating the need to manually implement page visit tracking on each page of your application.
