# ESLint Autofix Workflow

- **Use ESLint auto-fix only for issues that ESLint can automatically resolve**, such as import sorting. Do not sort imports manually.
- **Check lint errors first** - only run autofix when ESLint indicates the issues are auto-fixable.
- For issues that require manual fixes, address them directly in the code rather than relying on autofix.

## Single file fixes

Run from the repository root:

```bash
yarn eslint <path-to-file> --fix
```

## Multiple files

If your changes affect multiple files, run from the repository root:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```
